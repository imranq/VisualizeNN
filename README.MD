# VisualizeNN

A front-end neural network interface to teach students how changes in training size, cycles, and layers sizes can affect network weights. It uses a 3-layer network, and outputs the intermediate training predictions and the ideal input images to show how backpropagation changes the network.

# Future development

- Multiple layers and adjusting node sizes for each layer
- Intuitive interfaces to adjust connectivity between layers (fully connected vs. partially connected)
- Tilting data sets and generating new data
- GANs and convolutional filters
